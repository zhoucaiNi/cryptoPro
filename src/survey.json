    "Intro": "Welcome to Crypto Pro! This program will take you through the basics of investing in cryptocurrency (and other) markets. While this course will provide you with the necessary skills to buy and trade cryptocurrencies on this platform and others, this course should BY NO MEANS seen as a comprehensive or adequate introduction to cryptocurrency. We want to stress that as a retail investor, you are severely outmatched in the crypto market and should never expect to see the same gains as professional investors. With that being said, we are confident this course offers you the investing fundamentals you need to protect your assets and hopefully earn some profits in the crypto market. Good luck!",
